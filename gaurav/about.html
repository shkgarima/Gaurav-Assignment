    			<p> 
                     My name is Gaurav Ratna Shakya. My family has 4 people, my mom, my dad, my elder sister and me. My family is back in my country, Nepal. I currently reside in Melbourne, Australia. 
			I'm not a shy person. Since the start of school I've never really felt left. I always shake hands with people and talk to them. I try to talk as friendly as I can. I am good at replying texts as well so I guess that's why my bond with my school lads are still strong. I've made alot of friends ,helpful and kind here at FedUni as well. I aspire to have a career in Information Technology in the future as well, therefore, I am pursuing my undergraduate level studies in this field. Personally, I find the units that I learn really interesting and fulfilling. Hopefully, after the completion of my degree I will be able to have a successful career in this field.

                   Coming to Australia has exposed me to several hardships and challenges but at the same time I have learnt a great deal of things that made it easy for me to overcome these endeavours. One thing I have learnt is to always carry myself through everything and to never give up. This has been my motto of living.
